### reasons for choosing issue:

#### [#6039](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/6039) Font size increase does not increase preferences font size
1. The difficulty for this issue is proper 
2. Fixing this issue can help me understand the whole gui architecture of this project

#### [#6198](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/6198) Storing selected preview throws java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Value too long:
1. Valuable and severe bugs, which may encountered by user.
2. A little bit difficult in locating bug.
3. Funny.

#### [#6169](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/6169) ":PDF" will not show the pdf icon in the
1. Good first issue
2. Should be fixed in recent release 5.1
3. Nobody claims that

#### [#6146](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/6146) Can't jump in ordered author list by typing letters
1. Previously implemented, but lost in new release.
2. User requirement.
3. Nobody claims that.

#### [#6180](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/6180) Groups panel does not keep size when resizing window

2. User requirement.

## Test scenario

### [#6039](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/6039)

We have tried our best to use mock testing method to test. However, we came across inevitable hinder. We can't get the corresponding font size value from css file and only can get the metadata of css which is useless(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33144735/how-to-get-the-value-of-a-css-definition-in-javafx). Therefore, we can't write tests for this part.

## User story for each issue:

User will want to customize the font size of the UIï¼Œnot only the main window, but also pop up windows.
